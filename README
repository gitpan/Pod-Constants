Pod::Constants version 0.13
===========================

Pod::Constants allows you to extract data from your POD at run-time,
meaning you can do things like declare constants in POD and not have
to update two places at once every time you make a change.

This version adds the ability to read structured data from POD
sections, as well as insert arbitrary hooks into the extraction of
data.
